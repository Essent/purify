# What is _pure_?
<i>pure</i> is a standard library for functional programming in TypeScript. It's purpose is to allow developers to use popular patterns and abstractions that are available in ML-family languages. The core values of this library are:
* **Bringing the whole package** - The main goal of this library is to create a single cohesive tool that suits all functional programming needs of TypeScript developers
* **Type safety** - While _pure_ can be used in vanilla JavaScript, it's entirely written with TypeScript and type safety in mind.
* **Fantasy-land compatibility** - _pure_ implements the [Fantasy Land](https://github.com/fantasyland/fantasy-land) specification as much as possible (typeclasses cannot be correctly expressed in TypeScript)
